# front-end
The front-end for the fitte frietjes app.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## config file

The .env-cmdrc is the config file with multiple environments.


## folders (best practices)

Evert model/page has its own folder in the components folder

## External libs

### SCSS
Allow use of SCSS instead of vanilla CSS.

Allows cleaner and easier to maintain style files.

### Axios
"Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js."

Promise based keeps code clean.

### env-cmd
Allows us to use a config file
